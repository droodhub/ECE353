# ECE353
ECE353 Project Files from Spring 2023. Mostly in-class exercises, with one larger project as well. ICE 14-16 use FreeRTOS. The project is a meteor drop game where you have to
tilt the board to move your character to avoid falling meteors. All code was written in Code Composer Studio and is intended to be flashed onto the MSP432 Launchpad, often
using the MKII-EDU attachment as well.
